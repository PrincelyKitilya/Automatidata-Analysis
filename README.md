# Taxi Fare Regression Modeling - Automatidata (PACE Strategy)

This project analyzes fictional NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) data to build a regression model that predicts taxi fare amounts. The analysis follows the **PACE Strategy** (Plan → Analyze → Construct → Execute)

---

# Plan

## Project Goal 
Automatidata has been approached by the NYC TLC to support the development of an app that predicts taxi fares for riders **before** they take a trip. The goal is to build a regression model that estimates fare amounts using trip-related variables.

## Business Task 
- Compute descriptive statistics
- Build a regression model for fare prediction
- Prepare an executive summary for non-technical stakeholders


# Key Questions 
- What variables influence taxi fares the most?
- How well can a regression model predict fare amounts?
-What insights should the TLC consier for their fare-estimation app?


## Stakeholders 
- **TLC Operations Manager** (client)
- **Automatidata Data Team** (Me)
- **App Development Team** (uses the model in production)
